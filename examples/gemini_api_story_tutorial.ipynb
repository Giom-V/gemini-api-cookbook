    "\n",
    "Welcome to this story-driven tutorial for the Gemini API! This guide is designed for developers who are new to the Gemini API and want a fun, engaging way to learn about its capabilities. We'll go on a journey to create a children's story, and along the way, we'll explore various features of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Generate creative text for characters and stories.\n",
    "- Use structured output (JSON mode) to organize your content.\n",
    "- Ground your story in real-world information using web search.\n",
    "- Use the model to analyze and describe video content from a YouTube link.\n",
    "- Generate a title for your story.\n",
    "- Create a cover for your book using the image generation model."
